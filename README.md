### Hi there ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹
 - I'm Goyo, a self-taught learner in AI and machine learning 
 
 - I have a background in Electrical Engineering and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Fintech. However, my true interest lies in the world of AI.

 - Through my GitHub account, I explore and learn new techniques and algorithms in my spare time. My goal is to contribute my knowledge to larger-scale projects and achieve great things.
