## About Me

I'm an **Indie Developer** with a strong passion for fullstack development and technological innovation. Currently, I am learning how to build complete applications using **Reflex**, and I love exploring the potential of **AI** and the **Replicate API** to integrate cutting-edge solutions into my projects. My experience spans the **satellite and remote sensing industry**, as well as various university research groups, where I have developed innovative solutions that blend advanced technology with scientific analysis.

Throughout my professional and academic journey, I‚Äôve focused on the intersection of **software development**, **geospatial data analysis**, and **process automation**, always seeking to apply new technologies to solve complex problems and contribute to the advancement of knowledge.
